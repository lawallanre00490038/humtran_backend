# Security Emergency Response and Tracking System – Requirements Document

## 1. Overview

### Project Description
This system connects users in emergency situations with nearby security agents using real-time location tracking, secure communication (chat and calls), and live map visualization.

---

## 2. Goals

### Business Goals
- Reduce emergency response time.
- Improve safety and trust through technology.
- Provide employment opportunities for vetted security agents.

### User Goals
- Quickly report emergencies (e.g., robbery, fire, assault).
- Get matched with and tracked by nearby agents.
- Chat and call the agent in real-time.
- Track the agent's approach on a map.

### Non-goals
- Manage long-term security contracts.
- Replace traditional emergency services.

## 3. User Stories

### For Users
- As a user, I can sign up using email or phone.
- As a user, I can select the type of emergency.
- As a user, I can allow the app to auto-detect my location.
- As a user, I can view nearby agents on a live map.
- As a user, I can track the agent as they approach.
- As a user, I can chat or call the assigned agent.
- As a user, I can review the experience after resolution.

### For Security Agents
- As a security agent, I can register and update my live location.
- As an agent, I get alerted when an emergency happens nearby.
- As an agent, I can accept or reject requests.
- As an agent, I can communicate with the user via chat or call.
- As an agent, I can mark a task as resolved.

## 4. User Experience & Key Features

### Narrative
Emergencies are unpredictable, and delays in response can be fatal. This platform bridges the gap between victims and trained security personnel through real-time location sharing, communication, and smart emergency allocation.

### Key Features
- User & Security agent onboarding.
- Emergency categorization.
- Geo-location services and tracking.
- Real-time chat and voice calls.
- Map display with proximity tracking (Uber-style).
- Role-based dashboards.
- Rating and feedback.

## 5. Why Does This Matter?
Millions of emergencies go unaddressed or receive delayed attention due to infrastructural gaps. This system enables real-time response in a decentralized, scalable way—empowering both the public and trained responders.

---

## 6. Success Metrics
- Response time < 5 minutes.
- 10,000+ registered users within 6 months.
- 85%+ positive feedback from users.
- Average 4.5+ star rating for security agents.
- Geo-coverage expansion to 10+ major cities.

---

## 7. Technical Considerations

### Frontend
- Mobile App: React Native + TypeScript
- Web (Admin & Analytics): React.js + TailwindCSS

### Backend
- Node.js (Express) + TypeScript
- REST API with Swagger documentation
- Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
- Redis (for pub/sub & real-time tracking)

### Real-time Features
- WebSocket (e.g., Socket.IO) for live chat and tracking
- GeoJSON for map integration
- VoIP (e.g., Twilio or Agora) for in-app calls

### DevOps
- Docker for containerization
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Railway/Render for hosting
